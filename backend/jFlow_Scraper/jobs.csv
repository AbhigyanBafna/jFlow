---------------------

**HockeyStack helps B2B companies drive more revenue.**  

We're revolutionizing how marketing and sales teams leverage data and uncover insights from it. Our cutting\-edge data platform unifies and transforms data from CRMs, ad platforms, and websites in real\-time, extracting actionable insights to drive revenue.  

Every B2B company grapples with this challenge. If you've ever seen sales and marketing teams struggling to find effective strategies, you understand the problem we're solving. Join us in our mission to make good companies *great*.  

We graduated from YC’s Summer 23 batch and we've roughly doubled our ARR every 6 months since then. If you join, you'll be part of a high\-growth startup with proven product\-market fit, methodically building a billion\-dollar company through a high\-performance culture and exceptional talent. **What we value*** Builders.
* + Coding well is a rigorous craft. We are looking for people who enjoy coding just for the sake of it. That’s how you build really cool stuff.
* Ownership.
* + Expect to own a crucial part of the product within your first two weeks. No jokes. We’ve seen that only the ones who can take this kind of a responsibility can thrive in this environment.
* Shipping. *Fast.*
* + You don’t need to break things to move fast. But you do need a certain kind of mentality to know what shortcuts you can take and what tradeoffs you can make. How else can you grow fast if you aren’t deploying to prod every day?
* Scalability.
* + Writing production\-ready code is a very different thing when you have 1 customer versus over 100\. You should take pride in thinking through every line of code you write and any edge cases it might introduce.

 **Fun Facts*** Some of our SQL queries involve more than 500 lines of code.
* We are munging and managing more than 60TB of data for our customers
* We process high\-throughput data from 30\+ data sources

**About the role**
------------------

**Who were looking for**
------------------------


You might call yourself a platform engineer, an SRE, or just an empathetic developer. You enjoy building the infrastructure around which other fellow engineers can code and spend time thinking about how things scale.**What you will be doing**
--------------------------


The one\-liner is that you are operating the development team behind the scenes.  

You’ll primarily work on our AWS servers and infrastructure, get familiar with the Node.js backend and the Next.js frontend as well as the MongoDB and ClickHouse databases. You will be tasked with setting up the code deployments through Github Actions and also manage our Grafana/Prometheus setup.  

This role requires you to code Javascript on a daily basis so it is much more than a normal DevOps position you might see in another company. You will be our silent guardian. A watchful protector. You’ll code just like everyone else but your responsibilities lie beyond the code itself \- on how it interacts with the infrastructure.**Requirements:**
-----------------

* San Francisco, in person every day
* Good backend knowledge (Node.js)
* Great AWS experience (EC2, S3, EKS etc.)
* Sufficient knowledge around observability
* Composure even during the wildest fires
* Ready to work really hard on really hard problems

**Bonus Points:**
-----------------

* High\-growth SaaS experience, including scalability challenges

 **Benefits:**
Some of the cool benefits we offer aside from the cool technical work you get to do alongside some smart engineers:* TOP salary \+ meaningful equity
* Beautiful office near South Park in SF
* Gourmet catered daily meals from a chef
* Unlimited Beer \& diet coke (because who likes coke zero :d)
* 401K \& Health,Dental and Vision insurance",,https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Hockeystack,,,,,,
